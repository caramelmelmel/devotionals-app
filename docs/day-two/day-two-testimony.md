# Day 2 Testimony

One of our boom leaders had been believing for her family to encounter the love of God and for their salvation. One particular week, she went to Sydney to spend some time with her family. During their time together, her 11-year-old cousin became curious about how to experience the presence of God. This awesome leaser was able to lead her and two other cousins in prayer and introduce them to Jesus.

The following week her aunt and uncle told her that they had gone to Planetshakers' Sydney campus which was located only thirty minutes away. What a great God we serve! Even through unexpected situations and unqiue circumstances, he answered her prayer and spoke to her family, drawing them to himself. Thank you, Jesus!
