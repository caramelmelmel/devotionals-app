## Devotion

What incredible encouragement knowing that God is going with us! That alone is amazing because when God is with us, we are safe, provided for and have joy and peace. But the scripture goes on further to say that God will fight for us against our enemies and He will give us victory. Wow! This should fill our hearts with joy knowing that God will fight for us!

We face all sorts of enemies. Every day we come up against faceless enemies known as discouragement, fear, rejection, failure, anxiety and depression. It doesn't matter what the enemy is called, this scripture promises victory over all of them.

We are also not the ones doing the fighting. Have you ever fought for something for a long time? It can be draining, even exhausting. When we are at our lowest we can entertain hopelessness and sometimes even get to the point where we give up. Maybe it's a dream you have had that seems impossible to achieve even after your best efforts, but God is encouraging you today that the battle isn't even yours to fight. The promise is that God will fight for you and He will give you the victory.

That should surely put a spring in your step because you can let go of the strain of fighting. We can allow our God to open the doors, defeat the enemy and make a way where there seems to be no way. As we put our faith in Him, ask Him for the break-through and partner with Him in taking steps of obedience and living according to His Word and principles, we will see the defeat of all of our enemies!

## Prayer
Father, I thank You for Your promise to be with me and fight for me. Today I let go of all the doubts, fear and anxiety, and I put my total trust in You. Today I ask for the victory over all of the enemies that I face and I thank You that You will move on my behalf to bring about an amazing outcome because You are going with me. I pray all this in Jesus' name, Amen.
