# Day 4 Testimony

There's a woman in our church who has been dealing with quite severe anxiety and PTSD for around 15 years. She recently began journeying this with her coach and together believed God for healing and restoration in these areas. At Beautiful Conference this year, she had a powerful encounter with God and had a revelation of her heavenly Father's unrelenting love. Since then she has had many other significant encounters with God in services and alone, and has, over the past few months, seen amazing healing and restoration in her life, and has been awakened and set free from these debilitating illnesses

A man started coming to church with his partner but openly admitted that he was an atheist, had explored all religions, read the Koran and didn't believe in God. We bought him a Bible and sat down with him to answer any questions that he had and pray for him to get saved. Slowly over time, his heart began to open up and he began to have encounters with God during the services.
One day he raised his hand to respond to the altar call and made a decision to follow Jesus! Since then he has continued to go on a journey of growing in his faith, experiencing great transformation in his life leading him to make the decision to get baptised as a public declaration of his faith! He shared that all those years before, he knew God had been chasing him down, but now he was chasing God!
