## Devotion

It is true- we have an enemy.

The Bible talks about the devil roaming around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. His existence is a truth that our modern society wants to ignore and laugh off as 'ridiculous", but nevertheless, he hates us and his attacks are real. Fortunately for us as Christians, Jesus has given us many weapons to defeat the devil's schemes and constantly have victory over him.

This scripture talks about us having spiritual armour that can protect us from demonic attacks from every angle. It is comforting to know that Jesus completely defeated the devil when he stole the keys of death and hell from him, and positioned us on the winning team!

I love that this scripture encourages us to stand. What a wonderful picture! When the enemy hurls insults at us, lies to us or tries to tempt us, we simply need to stand, dressed in our armour, and put up our shield of faith to quench his fiery darts. Then we will see the victory that Jesus has already won, become a reality.

The enemy only has lies in his arsenal of weapons, so if we are familiar with God's Word and stand in faith believing it is true, we will see the victory of Jesus become our reality every single time. As we pray persistently in the Spirit, we will continue to move forward in our lives experiencing victory after victory for ourselves and others who we pray for. Our God is so good!

## Prayer

Thank you Lord that You are my protection and my shield. You have defeated the enemy so I can walk in that victory today. I stand in faith knowing that no weapon formed against me shall prosper and that the enemy is under my feet. Help me to not listen to his lies or be led to feel things or believe things that are not from you. Instead Lord, I put on the whole armour of God and stand in faith knowing that I have the victory in every circumstance.

Thank you Jesus, Amen.
