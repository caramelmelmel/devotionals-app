# Day 6 Testimony

One of the families in our church had a promise of God to move to Australia:
In 2018, they applied for a Permanent Residency Visa. Despite others being told that they would hear back within a year, this family never received any updates on the progress of their application. They heard of other families having their visa applications denied and having to return to their home countries. However, the family did not give up hope and instead, chose to position themselves in church and praise God continuously. Whenever the family heard success stories from others who had their visas granted, they believed that it would soon be them as well. They allowed each delay to be a learning experience and trusted that God would come through with His promise.

In a Sunday Service, Pastor Sam declared that permanent residence visas would be granted and they received it by faith. Sure enough, on the following Wednesday morning they received a call that their visa had been granted!
Thank you Jesus!
