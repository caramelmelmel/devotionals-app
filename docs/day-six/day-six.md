## Devotion

I don't know what happens to you when you read this scripture, but for me it brings great joy. What an incredible God we serve. God is for us!

Think of it like a parent seeing his or her child compete in a race You say focused on supporting and encouraging your child that you don't even notice others that surround them. You want the best for them and love them deeply. You are for them. You cheer for them, rejoice with them when they win, console them when they don't, comfort them if they fall and encourage them to race again. Your heart loves them no matter what they do. You are for them.

That is just a small picture of how our heavenly Father views us. He is for us no matter what. He is our biggest supporter, our loudest cheer leader and the proudest Dad. When we see God from this perspective, it brings great security and peace to our hearts. We no longer fear failure but instead realise that all we need to do is get in the race. We don't need to fear opposition either for no one is bigger, greater, stronger, wiser or richer than our God.

Fear can often paralyse us and stop us going forward in the wonderful calling that God has for our lives. This is where our perspective needs to change When we see that God is for us (so who can be against us?), we have no fear of anything getting in our way and opposing us. We therefore live a life full of courageous adventures with our God.

## Prayer

Dear Lord, help me to realise how much You are for me and because of they can do anything You call me to do. Free me of all limitations and let me nunn race with such enthusiasm and fearlessness.


I pray all this in Jesus name, Amen.
