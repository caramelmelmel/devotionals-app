## Devotion

Jesus was trying to explain to His disciples what must take place with His death and resurrection, but they were struggling to comprehend. It's only later that they truly understood what He was talking about. 

When we go through troubling situations, it's hard not to allow those circumstances to overwhelm us, stirring up all sorts of negative emotions that affect our thinking and ability to accurately comprehend what is happening in our lives. Jesus is trying to tell His disciples about the forthcoming events so that they won't be unravelled by their experiences but instead, find the peace they need in Him.

Our circumstances change all the time. If allow our emotional state to be influenced by our circumstances then we will live a troubled life that is plagued with fear of bad things happening and be unable to enjoy what is good. However, when our peace is in Jesus, He doesn't change so we can rest assured that He will be with us, calm the storm and turn all things around for good.

Jesus encourages the disciples to 'take heart'. This means to gain courage or confidence, and to begin to feel better and more hopeful. This is something that we should do when we face trials. When we look at our circumstances through the lens of Jesus, we see that things will turn around and that we can confidently hope for Him to help us in every situation that we face. 

## Prayer

Thank you Jesus that You are my peace. I look away from my circumstances and I look to You. Help me Lord to see through Your eyes and know that You have overcome the world, therefore I have nothing to fear about my day. Because You have overcome, I will overcome so I make the decision to take heart knowing that You will bring about the turn around. Amen.
