# Day 3 Testimony

A couple who used to attend our Geelong campus recently reached out to their old Urban Life coach. Thye were 28 weeks into pregnancy and the results of the scans showed that their unborn son's brain was developing abnormally . While the left side of the brain was progressing as it should, the right side was growing at a much slower rate. After consulting with medical professionals they were advised to consider terminating the pregnancy. This was a choice neither of them were prepared to make. When the family attended church that weekend, the congregation prayed for a miracle-- for complete healing of that baby.

The following Tuesday, the couple went in for a follow-up appointment with the doctors. The doctors were shocked to find that the scans were showing no sign of the problem in their unborn baby. Something miraculous had taken place. The baby was completely healed. Praise God that he is victorious! He is our Healer and he can turn things around for our Good!
