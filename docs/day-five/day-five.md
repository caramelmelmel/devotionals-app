# Day 5 Devotional

## Scripture
### James 1:1-8 (NLT)
<sup>1</sup>This letter is from James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am writing to the “twelve tribes”—Jewish believers scattered abroad. Greetings!

<sup>2</sup> Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles of any kind come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. <sup>3</sup> For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. <sup>4</sup> So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.

<sup>5</sup> If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. <sup>6</sup> But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind. <sup>7</sup> Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. <sup>8</sup> Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do.

## Devotion

What a challenge it is to look at our troubles as an opportunity for great joy! Some challenges can seem insurmountable, however. James is encouraging us to look at them from a completely different perspective.

Challenges are pathways to growth. When you think about something growing it has such positive connotations. Yet even in growing there is pain involved we don't like pain but it is necessary sometimes in order to learn.

I think of various people in the Bible who have inspired us through their stories of victory. The road was often hard for them. At times it seemed impossible for them to see God's promises come to pass, yet they did! They went through some hardships but came out on the other side, victorious. And every time,they grew in their knowledge and understanding of God, and in wisdom and character. They came out on the other side as the inspirational role models that we admire and are encouraged by today.

Trials have the same opportunity attached to them for us too. They can change us, rid us of weaknesses in our character and reveal a side of God that we ory ever heard about but are now experiencing for ourselves. We can come out on the other side as men and women of faith that can be used by God to encourage and inspire others.

I'm sure this is why James encouraged us to have the perspective of joy when we face trials because when we come through the trial, we will be better for it.
So next time something troubling comes your way, why not put a smile on your face and let joy stir in your heart knowing that you will see God move in your life like never before and you will experience, first-hand, the incredible power and might of our God.

## Prayer

Father,
I thank you, Father, for the trials I am facing right now. Help me to change my perspective and see it as a pathway to growth in my life. You will never let me down so I again put my trust in You to see the miracle that is awaiting me become a reality.

I pray all this in Jesus name, Amen.
