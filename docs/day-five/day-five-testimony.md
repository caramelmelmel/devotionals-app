# Day 5 Testimony

In 2006, one of our amazing young leaders was diagnosed with epilepsy:
Doctors could only offer her medication and told her that there was no cure.
When she accepted Jesus into her life, she started to refuse the idea that this sickness would be her reality for the rest of her life. One day God spoke to her and encouraged her to print photos of herself and put scriptures that promise healing, underneath her feet. She started declaring that she was healed. She kept trusting, believing and declaring this over and over for the next few years that followed. One day, she returned to the doctor for her check up again and the doctor was left amazed. There was no sign of epilepsy in her life! She is healed completely! 16 years after her initial diagnosis! God is faithful to heal!
