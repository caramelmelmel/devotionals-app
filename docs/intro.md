# SOAP devotional

SOAP stands for <b>S</b>cripture <b>O</b>bservation <b>A</b>nswer <b>P</b>rayer

## Foreword

One of our most beneficial Christian disciplines is a daily 'quiet time' or devotional time with God. If possible, the <b>start of the day</b> is the best time because it puts God first in our day. When we seek God first and his righteousness, he makes sure that all our needs are met. It's a powerful start to our day and it allows God to speak to us and us to him.

So how does one start this good habit? One of the days that has been beneficial to so many people is a process known as <b>SOAP</b>. No, it's not the soap you use in the shower, but maybe it is a spiritual one. SOAP stands for <em><b>S</b>cripture, <b>O</b>bservation, <b>A</b>nswer</em> and <em><b>P</b>rayer</em>. It's a simple method for reading scripture and applying it to your life.

## Using SOAP

To begin, take a particular scripture and write it down. After writing it down, ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you through the scripture and reveal the truth that is in it. This is your observation of the scripture. Write this observation down.

Then it's important to recognise how this applies to your life. This is its application. Again, ask the Holy Spirit to help you understand the application and write down how the scripture applies to your life.

Lastly, write a prayer about how you want to live out the scripture or change your thinking on that subject. Really, it's simply talking to God. Be honest. <b>If you don't understand something, ask him for help and he will</b>. Doing this every day will help you develop a wonderful conversation with God about his word. It will bring about change in your life and you will see the kingdom of God become a reality.

## Conclusion

In this particular publication, we ask that you use the scriptures that we have provided each day. That's a good start for the next 21 days and by then, you should have developed a pattern that you can continue on with as you build your relationship with God.
