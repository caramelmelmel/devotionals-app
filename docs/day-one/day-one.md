# Day 1 Devotional

## Scripture
### 1 John 5:1-15 (NLT)
<sup>1</sup>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has become a child of God. And everyone who loves the Father loves his children, too. <sup>2</sup> We know we love God’s children if we love God and obey his commandments. <sup>3</sup> Loving God means keeping his commandments, and his commandments are not burdensome. <sup>4</sup>For every child of God defeats this evil world, and we achieve this victory through our faith. <sup>5</sup> And who can win this battle against the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.

<sup>6</sup> And Jesus Christ was revealed as God’s Son by his baptism in water and by shedding his blood on the cross—not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms it with his testimony. <sup>7</sup> So we have these three witnesses— <sup>8</sup> the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and all three agree. <sup>9</sup> Since we believe human testimony, surely we can believe the greater testimony that comes from God. And God has testified about his Son. <sup>10</sup> All who believe in the Son of God know in their hearts that this testimony is true. Those who don’t believe this are actually calling God a liar because they don’t believe what God has testified about his Son.

<sup>11</sup> And this is what God has testified: He has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. <sup>12</sup> Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have God’s Son does not have life.

<sup>13</sup> I have written this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know you have eternal life. <sup>14</sup> And we are confident that he hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him. <sup>15</sup> And since we know he hears us when we make our requests, we also know that he will give us what we ask for.

## Devotion

There are so many wonderful truths in this passage of scripture! 

The first thing to recognise is that we are children of God. We are all part of the wonderful family of God and are accepted, loved and desired as members of His family. This gives us the capacity to love others and to live according to God's commands. 

People who try to fulfil the commands of God without this foundation of love and acceptance, often wind up legalistic or ritualistic, following the principles of God out of duty instead of out of loving relationship with their heavenly Father. Criticism, judgement and perfectionism are often the driving forces of this kind of viewpoint. 

Have you ever owned an electric toothbrush and before it's about to run out of battery power, it starts to run slower? The life in the toothbrush is running out so its not operating to its full potential anymore. The life that Jesus has for us means that we can operate at full power, fulfilling our potential and calling without running out of steam. What a wonderful promise! And then for us to read that God hears our prayers and answers them should assure us that the life that God has for us is the best life ever! 

All we need is found in the wonderful God who has brought us into His family through His Son and we have life forevermore. 

## Prayer
Dear Jesus, 

I am so grateful today that You are my brother and You have brought me into the family of God. I thank You for the life that You impart to me today that will enable me to love and be loved. I ask that You would help me to have an understanding of my position, that I have the best Heavenly Father and that You hear and answer my every prayer. Bless my fellow brothers and sisters. Help me to love well and to walk in victory. 

In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
